Whiteboard
==========

Whiteboard is an online drawing application that allows users to draw in real time with other collaboraters


How to install:
---------------

Currently, you should install any deps, for the front end, we only require [LiveScript] [1], and installing dependencies for the backend is quite simple.

First off, you will need an install of mySQL, make sure you have that before proceeding.

Then, navigate to the directory setup.py is and enter the following command:

```$ pip install -e . ```

You then have all the dependencies for Whiteboard's backend. Hooray.
