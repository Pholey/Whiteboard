Note to developers
==================
Grunt will compile all of your livescript for you!


To get the Chaplin version (new-frontend) working you need npm. 
 - npm install -g grunt-cli bower
 - npm i && bower i
 
 
Navigate to the folder "New-frontend" and sym-link your bower components. Or read up on grunt and submit a pull request.
 - ln -s bower_components components
 
 
Run that bad boy.
 - grunt
 

Now go to your browser.
You can find your port in the terminal after grunt has finished.
 - localhost:{port-number}
